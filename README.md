You have to install all libraries in the requirements.txt in your Python 3._ Virtual Environment. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3._.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data in Boston from Sep 06, 2016 to Sep 05, 2017 and in Seattle from Jan 04, 2016 to Jan 02, 2017 to better understand:

1. Available Homestays By Time Period
2. Airbnb Homestays distribution in cities
3. Homestays Price Prediction based on other Factors

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
